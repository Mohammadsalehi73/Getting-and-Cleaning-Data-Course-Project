Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project (a Peer-graded Assignment) greated by Mohammad salehi
Current repository is my submission toward Getting and Cleaning Data course project. The collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set ability is the purpose of this project.

Dataset abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Files

code book: CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R: An R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
A- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
B- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
C- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
D- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
E- From the data set in step D, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Project_output.txt is the exported file after going through all above_mentioned steps.
